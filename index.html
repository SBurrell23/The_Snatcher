IDEAS

The Snatcher (2+ Players)
One player is the snatcher, the rest are runners.
A procedurally generated maze is created.
The snatcher spawns in the middle of the maze, the runners spawn on the outside.

The snatcher has to catch all the runners before:
    the runners escape by finding X keys hidden on the map and bringing them to the (2) doors
    (players can only hold 1 key at a time)
    (doors will require something like {numPlayers * 3} keys to open)
    (The keys are MAYBE??? visible to everyone but not on anybodys map)
    (the number of keys that spawn should be something like ({numPlayers*3} * 2) + 2)

THE MAP
The map is a procedurally generated maze (20*20 ?)
The map is 2D/2D Array
The runners can only see the rooms they have been in
Each runner can see the snatchers location on the map always
The snatcher CAN SEE THE ENTIRE MAP, but not the players
    The snatcher has a "hint" on each door about how far away from any player they are
The doors will be marked on snatchers map when the first one is opened.

The snatcher catches the runners by touching them
If a runner is caught, they are out and can spectate another player of their choosing
If a runner had a key(s) when they were caught, it is dropped on the ground

As the # of available runners decreases, the snatcher gets faster?

The game ends when:
    All the runners are caught or escaped
    The snatcher ragequits

    Runners get a Point for adding a key to the door
    Runners get more points for escaping

    The Snatcher gets a Point for catching a runner
    The Snatcher gets an extra point for total runners caught on game over



The snatcher has very limited room visibility (but can see the entire minimap and is faster)
This way players can hide if they are in the same room

Players will also potentally not have FULL visibility of the rooms, but much more then the snatcher


THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF SKILLCHECK GAME WHEN PICKING UP A KEY/ITEM IN ORDER TO GET IT
Maybe every item is a trunk, and you have to search it and then get either a key or item

If any skillcheck game is failed, your loation is revealed on the map to the snatcher for X seconds


MORE IDEAS
Maybe a magic fireplace or two that can be used to teleport from one side of the map to another

Add a PF FYERS powerup runners can find that makes them faster for a short period of time
Add a THE BUTTON for runners, that randomly teleports them to a new room when activated
    Using this powerup will cause you to drop any keys you are holding
Add a MAGIC MONOCLE powerup for runners that lets them see the map + doors + (keys?) for a short period of time) 


Add a CHILI BBQ powerup the snatcher can find that temporarily reveals the players on the map to them
Add a EDWARDS EYEBALLS powerup that expands their vision for a moderate period of time
Add a KILL THE POWER powerup that turns off all players maps for a moderate period of time
