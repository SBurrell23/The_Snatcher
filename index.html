IDEAS

show other players that are connected as colored...

(doors will require something like {numPlayers * 3} keys to open)

The exit doors will be marked on snatchers map when the first one is opened.

when a global event occers, display text on all players screens saying so.

If a runner is caught, they are out and can spectate another player of their choosing


As the # of available runners decreases, the snatcher gets faster?

The game ends when:
    All the runners are caught or escaped
    The snatcher ragequits



MORE IDEAS
Maybe a magic fireplace or two that can be used to teleport from one side of the map to another

PF FLYERS powerup runners can find that makes them faster for a short period of time
MAGIC MONOCLE powerup for runners that lets them see the map + players + doors for a short period of time) 
THE BUTTON for runners, that randomly teleports them to a new room when activated
    Using this powerup will cause you to drop any keys you are holding
    

BBQ CHILI powerup the snatcher can find that temporarily reveals the locations of all players on the map
SPARE EYEBALLS powerup that increases their room vision for a moderate period of time
KILL THE POWER powerup that turns off all players maps for a moderate period of time


NEW THEME IDEA INSTEAD OF HAUNTED HOUSE
HEAUNTED FOREST
The exit gates are exit portals and require X 'crystals' to power on
The solid objects can all be types of trees
ambient noise can be spooky forest and walking can be leaves crunching


 each player can only be selected once and has a special stat
 Randal - has an even larger spotlight
 Eluid - can run slightly faster
 Vincent - Easier skill checks


fix bug where holding shift other modfiied locks movement
fix coliision so players can get right up next to a wall always
