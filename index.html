IDEAS

If a runner is caught, they are out and can spectate another player of their choosing

As the # of available runners decreases, the snatcher gets faster?

TODO:

SOUNDS

ALSO
GOLD + SILVER PORTAL (each requires its own colored gem to activate)
This will make the game longer for runners

ALSO
add a pickup time for searching through a bag for keys
so runners must wait at a bag for 10 seconds or so to pull a gem from it (they dont know which gem too))



each player maybe has a special stat

1.has an even larger spotlight
2.can run slightly faster
3.slightly Easier skill checks
4.exit gates open faster
5.

fix bug where holding shift other modfiied locks movement
fix coliision so players can get right up next to a wall always


killer item that locks the dooors temporarily...
