IDEAS

The Snatcher (2+ Players)
One player is the snatcher, the rest are runners.
A procedurally generated maze is created.
The snatcher spawns in the middle of the maze, the runners spawn on the outside.

The snatcher has to catch all the runners before:
    the runners escape by finding X keys hidden on the map and bringing them to the (2) doors
    (players can only hold 1 key at a time)
    (doors will require something like {numPlayers * 3} keys to open)
    (The keys are MAYBE??? visible to everyone but also not on the runners map)
    (the number of keys that spawn should be something like ({numPlayers*3} * 2) + 2)

THE MAP
The map is a procedurally generated maze
The map is 2D/2D Array
Only the runners can see the map
Each runner can only see the exit doors on the map once they come across them
Each runner can see the snatchers location on the map always
The snatcher can not see the map, 
    BUT instead has a "hint" on each door about how far away from any player they are
The entire map + doors WILL be revealse to the snatcher once 1 door is opened

The snatcher catches the runners by touching them
If a runner is caught, they are out and can spectate another player of their choosing
If a runner had a key when they were caught, it is dropped on the ground

As the # of available runners decreases, the snatcher gets faster

The game ends when:
    The snatcher catches all the runners
    All the runners are caught or escaped
    The snatcher ragequits

    Runners get 1 Point for adding a key to the door
    Runners get 1 Point for escaping

    The Snatcher gets 1 Point for catching a runner
    The Snatcher gets 3 extra points for catching all the runners


MORE IDEAS
Maybe add blue portals on the map for runners to use and red portals for the snatcher to use

Add a BOOTS powerup runners can find that makes them faster for a short period of time

Add a BBQ powerup the snatcher can find that temporarily reveals the map & players to them
